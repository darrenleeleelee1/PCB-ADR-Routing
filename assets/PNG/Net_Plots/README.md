# Net Plots Directory

This directory contains visual outputs from the `draw_nets_pins.py` script, which generates graphical representations of PCB nets from `.adr` files. Each PNG file corresponds to a specific case, with component pins depicted as circles and each component in a unique color for clarity.

## Files

- `2.png` - Net plot for case 2.
- `3.png` - Net plot for case 3.
- `4.png` - Net plot for case 4.
- `5.png` - Net plot for case 5.
- `6.png` - Net plot for case 6.

The `draw_nets_pins.py` script is responsible for creating these visualizations. For more details on the script usage or to generate new plots, refer to the script's documentation.
